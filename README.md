Image generation and processing.

Output uploaded to <https://instagram.com/apaverspan/>
Inputs in the 'in' folder. I'm cheating a bit with the image processing code, as my source images are all squares that are the same size as the output image, so this code won't necessarily work with any other source without some tweaking.

At some point I may regret not using something with a more complete set of functionality, like p5, but not today.

The output size of 1400x1400 was chosen to match the minimum image size that Bandcamp allows for cover art.
